During its first year, our fledgling society attracted around 10 members who regularly contributed to the design of DNGN. The scope of this design was quite small in that we came up with the name, genre, basic gameplay loop and other such details but then proceeded to really refine the vision for that gameplay loop. By the time we were ready to start development proper, we were all on the same page that the game would be a co-op dungeon crawler with a ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"heavy"}]," focus on weapons being intrinsically tied to movement and especially the interaction between two weapons leading to a novel experience."]}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"Notes"}],["$","p",null,{"children":["Time-wise, my contributions amount to around 30% of the total man hours, with the majority of that being spent writing gameplay and systems code. A not-at-all insignificant portion of time was also dedicated to architecting the game with the 2 other co-leads. For example, one day we began a joint coding session by spending a few hours, whiteboard at the ready, deciding how to go about enabling enemies to use weapons exactly like players would. This led to the idea to make a \"virtual joystick\" which an item would respond to and having the player register their ",["$","em",null,{"children":"real"}]," joystick to the virtual one while an enemy would move the virtual joystick with their AI. (I then proceeded to implement the Item code while my teammate was implementing the Enemy code).

Hexii is absolutely designed with a casual audience in mind, but I believe the magic of incremental games is their ability to appeal to the hardcore gamer mindset as well. Designing an incremental is fundamentally asking the question \"how can I keep my players ",["$","em",null,{"children":"maximally engaged"}]," with as little as possible\". Finding new and interesting ways to make a number go up is a joyful task! Unfortunately, it's also very difficult to get right... Mostly it comes down to the maths of how costs in the game increase vs resource yields. The simpler the formula and interactions are, the easier it is to design for, but the less interesting it ends up for the player at the other end because things tend to become too stale too quickly. Carefully adding in progression \"walls\" and solutions that remove them or otherwise introduce new aspects of gameplay is difficult to get right (and usually requires tester feedback), but when done well leads to a highly fun game."]}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"Code"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Everything you see in hexii was made by me, from the assets to the code (except the framework).

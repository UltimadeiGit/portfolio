Designing an incremental is fundamentally asking the question \"how can I keep my players ",["$","em",null,{"children":"maximally engaged"}]," with as little as possible\". Finding new and interesting ways to make a number go up is a joyful task! Unfortunately, it's also very difficult to get right... Mostly it comes down to the maths of how costs in the game increase vs resource yields. The simpler the formula and interactions are, the easier it is to design for, but the less interesting it ends up for the player at the other end because things tend to become too stale too quickly. Carefully adding in progression \"walls\" and solutions that remove them or otherwise introduce new aspects of gameplay is difficult to get right (and usually requires tester feedback), but when done well leads to a highly fun game."]}]}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"Code"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"page_callout_backdrop__TFqPa","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":"Everything you see in Hexii was made by me, from the assets to the code (except the framework).
